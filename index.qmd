## Overview

This MicroRotation introduces the field of [**systems vaccinology**]{style="color:#0271BC"}, which uses "multi-omics" approaches combined with computational modeling to provide insights into vaccine-induced immunity.

Focusing on [Pertussis]{style="color:#0271BC"} (whooping cough), students will use the R programming language to analyze pre- and post-vaccination multi-omic datasets from the NIH-funded  [**C**ommunity for **M**odeling **P**ertussis **B**oost (**CMI-PB**)](https://www.cmi-pb.org/){target="_blank"} project.

This will be followed by a modeling section that demonstrates how pre-vaccination data can be used to predict post-vaccination immune responses. Finally, students will participate in an open community prediction challenge. The goal of which is to predict from pre-vaccination data the immune responses of 54 new individuals after pertussis booster vaccination.

## Location
We will meet from [1:30-4:30pm]{style="color:#0271BC"} in [**TATA 3101**]{style="color:#0271BC"}  ([Map](https://goo.gl/maps/Cd8z9Zexx6q){.external target="_blank"}) on Tuesday, September 10th through Thursday September 12th. On the last day we will be in [**TATA 3103**]{style="color:#0271BC"}. These rooms are both near the main TATA Kavli Auditorium.
